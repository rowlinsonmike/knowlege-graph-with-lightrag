Report,69323,Class A,2021-06-13,20 miles east of Petrified Forest National Park -- motorhome driver and wife report daylight sighting from Interstate 40 ,2021,Summer,,Arizona,Apache,"Original witness note: ""Near dead end rd beside I 40 west""",Holbrook,I 40 west,"Heading west on I-40 today at 0930 my wife and I saw a Bigfoot 100-150 yards from the hwy heading north. It was not running, but walking. It never looked at the hwy. It must have been 7-8 ft tall. It was thick, as in well built !",No,"1 my wife , riding in passenger seat",No,"Morning, 915-930","In front of rock hill, desert environment",Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Chuck Jacobs,"Investigator Notes (Chuck Jacobs):I texted witness Bill Weldon. He texted back and later we spoke on the phone for approx 45 minutes.  He is very well-spoken and  very serious and credible.  He is from Florida. This is his first trip west. He advised that he and his wife Carri both saw the bigfoot. He says it was ""about the same distance away as the billboards"" along the highway.  They watched it for 15-20 seconds as they passed by at highway speed. There is no doubt whatsoever in their minds as to what it was.  He described it as having dark colored hair, and that the lower legs and feet looked lighter colored due to the dust from the dry, reddish-tan soil in the area.  He advised that they could actually see dust kick up with each step.  He stated there was steady highway traffic at the time. Due to the bigfoot's proximity to the highway and it's dark color against the light background, there is ""NO WAY"" that other drivers did not see it.   _____________________________________Investigator Notes (Matt Moneymaker): I spoke with Bill Weldon and his wife Carri. They are both very credible. They are now in northern California staying with relatives. They are available to speak with local (AZ) reporters if requested.This is a very reliable multi-witness daylight sighting. It is neither a hoax nor a misidentification. It is an important report because of the location. The location may indicate an important migration pathway for saquatches in this part of Arizona -- Apache County.There is also a good chance that tracks from this incident may still be visible there. It would be a good places for Arizona investigators to check out soon, before it rains. Fortunately it doesn't rain much in June in this region.On the map, Apache County, Arizona, is a long vertical shaped county encompassing more than half of state border with New Mexico. The northern half the county is the Navajo Indian Reservation. The bottom portion of the county is Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Those two portions are mostly mountainous and very squatchy (lots of tree cover and running water and deer, etc.). In those portions there are lots of sighting reports of sasquatches. In between those two lush mountainous zones is wide open high desert with almost no water. This 100 mile expanse would be inhospitable to sasquatches, but sasquatches would NEED to cross that open expanse to get from one mountainous zone to the other.  How would they do it?  Which way would they go? Until now there were no reports in that open stretch of desert. This report is in the middle of that stretch, half way in between the two mountainous zones.The BFRO web site shows eleven (11) reports for Apache County as of June 2021. Those are the reports which are posted publicly. In the BFRO's internal database there are 51 reports total for Apache County. Most have not been investigated or they are second-hand storeis, etc. All of the other reports besides this one report are clustered in the two mountainous zones mentioned above: 1) In the North: The Chuska Mountains and connecting terrain around Window Rock. All of this zone is within the vast Navajo Indian Reservation.2) The South: The Mogollom Rim portion, very roughly between Show-Low and Alpine and the Fort Apache Reservation.The witnesses in this report are both very certain that the figure was: a) not a human in dark clothing, nor b) a human in a bigfoot costume. It ""did not have long flowing body hair"". Rather, it was covered with short dark fur. It seemed very natural like a real animal. Both said it seemed too large to be a human -- very tall and lanky but with very muscular legs. Its arms were swinging as it walked.The sasquatch did not seem hurried or fleeing from view. Bill's impression was that it was like the pace and movement of a person who is ""exhauasted"" and walking ""in a trance "" trying to get somewhere.Thirty minutes or so before the sighting Bill and Carri had stopped at the ""Indian Ruins Indian Store"" just before Sanders AZ as you head west on I-40. The store was closed but they let their dogs walk around near the store. One dog is a black labrador. After walking around the black lab had a lot of red dust on its black fur. Bill and Carri said the sasquatch had he same tinge of red dust on the fur of its legs. Both Bill and Carri say the overall color of fur was not jet black but rather a ""dark gray"".They are certain that it was also spotted by others on I-40 because some vehicles ahead of them slowed down as if to get a better look. The BFRO did not receive any other reports of this incident.The elevation of the sighting location is roughly 5,800 feet. It is high desert with patches of pinion pine and cedar among boulder outcroppings. On the day of the incident the temperature ranged from lows in the upper 50's Fahrenheit to highs in the upper 80's Fahrenheit.  At 9:30 am the temperature would have been in the mid 70's F.  Hence, it was broad daylight but not very hot yet. The sasquatch may have been walking all night from the south and simply continued walking north in daylight before the temperature got too hot. The area where it was spotted heading north is entering hilly terrain with lots of boulder outcroppings with many cave-like crevices providing shade from the sun. Also, near where it was seen there is a big stream gully that passes underneath Interstate 40. Thus it was possible this creature could cross the highway in daylight without being seen until it was many yards from the highway. The stream bed near the highway appears to be very brushy but it likely dry most of the time. The stream has no name but connects to the Puerco River on the other side of highway. The Puerco River has water flowing through it after rains but it is dry at other times. It flows southwest to Petrified Forest National Park. The National Park has a lot of wildlife including Mule deer, Pronghorn antelope and dozens of different species of mammals.The closest area with an established history of sightings is 40 miles to the northeast: The Window Rock area of the Navajo Reservation. Twenty miles beyond Window Rock to the north lies the Chuska Mountains on the Arizona / New Mexico border. The Chuska Mountain Range is well known among bigfoot researchers and Navajo Indians as a sighting area. The culmination of all this information begs particular questions: How far can a sasquatch walk without accessing water? How many miles?  How many days can it go without water?A human would simply not be able to walk across this 100 miles of desert with no water, certainly not in June, even if the person only walks at night.  In Winter, after snow storms, there wouild be patches of snow in shaded spots that would provide water for a migrating animal, but not in June.Even if a summer rainstorm occurred just prior to this sighting which caused water to run in the Puerco River, there is still 50 miles of desert in between that river and Mogollom Rim zone to the south.On the one hand this type of high desert terrain would allow a large dark sasquatch to be spotted from a long distance, even from a small aircraft.  On the other hand, this sasquatch was probably only passing through the area on its way between the mountain ranges. It probably doesn't pass through very often. That is merely an assumption though. The accessibility of the location makes it a good place to investigate if you happen to live between Winslow and Gallup, or you'll be passing through there along Interstate 40 (Route 66).Yes, now would be a good time to get your kicks on Route 66, before it rains. If you have an opportunity please look around the location for tracks, especially where that stream bed passes underneath the hightway.

Report,69452,Class A,2021-07-15,Grandfather and Granddaughter See Figure in Englewood Yard,2021,Spring,March,Florida,Sarasota,,Englewood,Bayshore Dr.,,,2,none,"Morning, clear weather, low 66, high 84",Suburban older homes by stream that flows to the Intracoastal waterway.,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator R. Monteith,"I spoke with the gentleman about his sighting in person and on the phone.Best to his recollection this occurred on March 27, 2021 between 8-8:30 am. Prior to this event he never gave a thought to a skunkape or bigfoot being anything other than folklore. On the morning of March 27, he was preparing breakfast with his wife. The kitchen has a window that looks across their backyard. When he turned to ask his wife a question movement outside the window caught his eye. He saw a dark bipedal figure walk from a group of trees toward a wooded area before disappearing from his line of sight. He asked his wife if she had seen that, just as his 8 year old granddaughter came running from the dining room yelling Grandpa, did you see that? She had seen the figure as well from the back sliding glass door. She described it as big. He admits that he at first wondered what his neighbor was wearing but realized it was taller than his 64 neighbor. He went on to describe that the figure was about 50 ft away, with a slim build but tall. It was walking west to east (L to R) as they was looking north out the windows.The family is very credible as to what happened that morning. It was obviously something they had never expected to see or experience.When researching this area it is not necessarily an area that one would expect to have this sort of activity. However the homes are spaced out on one acre or more lots and some are heavily wooded. His back yard connects to Manasota Scrub Preserve which connects to agricultural and green areas and then Myakka State Forest. Much of that area at the time of this sighting was very dry without having had substantial rain for many months which may have driven this animal towards water and in this case Forked Creek which is across the street from this mans home",27,,,,,,

We had recently finished dinner. While sitting fire side our dogs, a border collie and a pug leapt up and ran into the forest that separated the campsite from the creek. Neither made any sound but simply ran into the woods at twilight. Frustrated at the thought of chasing dogs in the woods at night I retrieved my flashlight from the cab of my truck. Upon approaching the tree line the dogs exploded out of the woods and ran to the truck where they cowered in fear staring into the woods.","Rock thrown. Tree broken, dogs in a panic.","2. Camping, sitting by the fire",,Approx 845 pm clear skies 65 degrees a thunderstorm had come through about 430pm,"Pine forest, creek side, canyon bottom.",Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Kevin Llewellyn,"I talked to the witness by phone.The witness and his girlfriend set up camp with a spare tent as more people were to come later in the camping trip. The only other camp was one quarter mile away. They had cooked steaks and oysters for dinner. When the dogs came running back from the trees, they were whimpering.The witness had his flashlight on the figure for at least two seconds and knew it was not a bear. It was leaning out from behind an approximately two foot diameter pine tree. He saw the right side of the upper body, the lower body was covered by bushes. He estimates the shoulder width at four feet based on the tree diameter. The right arm hung down into the bushes so no hand was seen. It was eight feet tall with smooth, shiny black hair about three inches long. The head was conical with no neck. The nose was broad, not a bear snout. Hair from the head hung down to the eyes. No ears or teeth were seen. No eye shine was seen. The skin on the face was black. No foul odor was detected. He used the words ""bulky"" and ""enormous"" to describe the figure.   When the rock was thrown, it hit the sticks in the fire and sparks landed on the side of his dining canopy. He stated he would never shoot at it, but shot into the air, and they continued to hear it move around and a tree break. The entire encounter was about forty five minutes. He and his girlfriend were very frightened, even though he felt it would not harm them. It affected him for a long time and he has just been sharing the encounter the past couple years. (He apologized for not turning in a report to the BFRO sooner - but we discussed a lot about bigfoot behavior and no apology needed.) He will not go camping again.

He was driving.,A out a month ago I thought I saw him but I wasnt sure. Im always looking when we go out. Now Im sure,,Its a wooded area right by the river. Theres no nearby homes. There is one just west of there maybe half mile away.,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Matthew Moneymaker,"I spoke with the witness, Patricia Parcel, and her son Adrian. She is 65 years old and lives in Belmont KS with her son. They have lived in Belmont for two years or so, and lived in Kingman KS before that.This brief sighting occurred two days ago (5/17/21) around 6pm. Her son was driving her back home from a doctor's appointment in Witchita. She spotted the figure as they were crossing the bridge over the South Fork of the Ninnescah River. They both saw the figure briefly but she got a better look at it.  She estimates it was 150 feet away from the bridge. He estimates 200 feet away. It was on the north side of the bridge and the west side of the river. It was across from the small island visible in the photo below, which she sent me a little while ago after returning to the location with her son to take photos of the location. The location of the intersection signs (see photo below) is half a mile west of the bridge.She and her son both say the water level is higher today than two days ago. More of the sandy creek bank was visible then. The figure was standing on the river bank out from the treeline. It was a few feet from the water. Right now the spot where it was standing is under water. She could not guess the height of the figure but both witnesses say it was reddish brown and distinct from the green treeline behind it. She is certain it was covered with fur. She says she could definitely see its arms and hands. The hands were darker in color than the body fur. She had heard about two other BFRO reports on or near the same river over the past 20 years so she would look for  sasquatches whenever driving through the area.She thought she had seen a similar figure in roughly the same spot previously but didn't get a good look at it while passing over the bridge. This time she got a better look at it. There was nothing like a stump or debris in the area spot today.The pin on the map may not be the exact spot the figure was standing but it isn't far off. The county road crossing this river is the type of back road in Kansas which may only see a few vehicles each day.  Her son says locals driving these roads do not drive faster than about 50 miles per hour because there are so many deer it is unsafe to drive any faster.This location seem like a good place to look for tracks, etc., right now.For the Google Maps pin for the location of the figure seen in this incident, click here.]",17,,,,,,

I was living on a road surrounded by woods. I went out to take my dog for a walk. Our driveway connected to a dirt road that ran up the side from the main rd. We walked to the end of the dirt road and along that road is a tree lining of woods. As we started heading back I looked over a noticed a tall figure staring at me at the edge of the woods. I couldnt make out what it was. It was definitely taller than 7ft and stood on two legs. It had orangish eyes. I started walking back down the road towards my house and when I would stop it would stop an look at me. I would walk some more, so would the thing and then once I stopped it stopped and would look at me. At this point I was really freaked out so I yelled for my dog to run and we sprinted towards the house. When I finally got inside I looked down our driveway and across the road at the tree line and the figure was there still staring at me. I told my father but when he looked he saw nothing.",No noises.

She was a teenager at the time of the incident. She no longer lives in the house mentioned in the report. She says the area now has many more houses than back in 2000. Tanglewood Road has been extended as well.She said the figure was a silhouette but definitely not a bear because it was simply too tall and walked on two legs the entire time it paralleled her. It was not more than 5-6 feet into the woods from the side of the roadI asked about the eyes and whether they appeared to be glowing or just reflecting light. She said the eyes seemed to be glowing dimly (which is a common feature of many night time encounters). The color was somewhere between orange and yellow.  Although she became more frightenned as the stalking continued she said the figure was not otherwise aggressive or hostile. She knew very little about the sasquatch/bigfoot subject at the time. It was many years later that she learned more and realized the figure that paralleled her that night was likely one of these creatures, by process of elimination.",,,,,,,

The main question with this report is whether he misidentified a human at that distance  140 yards.One test that anyone can do in these circumstances is to open the phone app Google Earth  (free). Zoom in on your own street or where ever you have a view for at least a block. Use the ruler function to set a point where you are standing then measure to a point 420 feet away (140 yards). At 420 feet you would be able to see an illuminated figure well enough to see if its a bear, or if it is wearing clothes or appears to be covered with fur.During the conversation he mentioned that the face appeared to be a slightly lighter color of skin that the cinnamon brown hair, but beyond that he could not discern facial details. Check that yourself at 420 feet. Can you see if a persons face is lighter color than hair, but not much more.The creature was 30-40 feet from nearest house. It was illuminated by a light in back of the house. It was pacing back and forth 20-25 feet span. It had a very smooth gait when pacing back and forth.

Report,71751,Class B,2021-10-24,Possible sighting in Mohican State Park near Loudonville,2021,Summer,June,Ohio,Ashland,Take Rt. 97 to Park Rd then turn right at the Covered Bridge onto Pleasant Hill Lake Trail Rd,Loudonville,Pleasant Hill Lake Trail Rd,"It was June 18th, 2021 about 4:00 pm at Mohican State Park, Loudonville, Ohio in Ashland County. My best friend and Idrove into the picnic area at the Covered Bridge, and there were no campers, hikers, or people fishing, so we drove into Campsite B, its a narrow road that is parallel to the Mohican River. Then we reached the end of this road where there is a turn-around, so we parked the car and shut off the engine. The front of the car was facing towards the Covered Bridge and the Mohican River was on the driverside of the car, and the thick woods were on the passenger's (my side) and to the rear of us. Also, it was an unusually chilly day for the month of June and it was very cloudy, with no sun and a slight drizzle of rain. So, we sat in the car with the windows down, we could hear birds chirping and the soft babbling sounds of the river. We sat there for about 30 minutes, talking away as women do and I mentioned that I watched a Bigfoot show on tv and we should do ""bigfoot calls"". So, jokingly I started doing whoop whoop calls and it echoed in this small area, we laughed for a couple of minutes then took a drink of our pop and we heard two tree knocks, not loud but not soft. Instantly, I was scared because the sound was very close to us, it was about 30 feet up in the thick woods, and it was very steep, almost straight-up. I knew this was not a person because it's too dangerous to climb. This spooked both of us so we started the car and went back to the Covered Bridge picnic area which is more of an open area. Also, there were a few cars so we did not feel alone, and my friend had to use the restroom and I stayed in the car. The woods were still on my right side and I could hear birds chirping loud and fast then all of a sudden they stopped. Then a rock that was about 6 inches wide came tumbling down on the ground of this steep cliff along with dry leaves falling behind it. So I looked up and about 15-20 feet away I saw the left side of a foot, calf, thigh, and hip of an animal. It looked like it was slipping on the leaves and was trying to gain traction and its leg went straight up and behind a tree. This leg looked like a bodybuilder's leg with short black hair and was about 3-4 feet in length. Then my friend got into the driver's side of the car and we left. So, when I got home I looked up videos on youtube of bears. My leg sighting does not match a bear leg because the hind leg of a bear or dog has an odd angle from the pad of the foot to its leg. But what I saw was a human-like foot with hair that connected to a calf, to a knee, to a thigh then to a hip, and it was super muscular. Also, there have been NO bear sightings in Mohican State Park for many decades.",I thought it was strange that the birds were extremely loud & chirping faster than usual then stopped like all of them...,two of us heard the wood knocks and only one of us saw the leg of the animal,"No, I have never heard of any sightings in this area but recently there were two sightings in the northern part of this county.","It was from 4:00 to 4:30 pm...it was chilly for a summer day, cloudy, no sun, slight drizzle of rain, on & off","It is mixture of Pine, Oak, & Maple Trees along the Mohican River near the Covered Bridge about a mile from the Pleasant Hill Dam & Pleasant Hill Lake",Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Matthew Moneymaker, ,18,,,,,,

He is very credible and works in law enforcement for the state of Ohio. Because he works in law enforcement he is barred from speaking to the media as an identified law enforcement officer. That's a common thing for most of the country. Thankfully he agreed to meet with a prominent local jouranlist who was willing to document the incident for a local news story but without revealing the witness's name, though the journalist was allowed to verify that he was a law enforcement officer as part of his due diligence. The witness did not get a Class A view of the figure walking across the field but he was able to observe it for a while. The photos below show the grassy field and demonstrate why there were no clear footprints afterward. As stated in the report, the witness investigated the incident himself not long afterward by asking his adult son to stand and walk where the figure had walked. See his comments about that in his report. For the first time we have a witness who is willing to take questions from people about the incident and/or the photos shown below.

Report,69065,Class A,2021-04-25,Recent encounter behind Warehouse 24 Gym on the outskirts of Ashland,2021,Spring,April,Ohio,Ashland,[Investigator notes: The sasquatch was spotted at the edge of the treeline behind the Warehouse 24 Gym on the outskirts of Ashland.,Ashland,St Rt 250,"My 20 year old step daughter had a visual sighting last night in Ashland, Ohio. The date was 4/24/2021.  It was about midnight and she had left a 24 hour gym that has woods behind it. She saw a gray over 7 foot creature after hearing a twig snap.  She stated it was way too large to be human and it moved way too fast to be human.",No,No,No,Night,"Cool, calm spring evening",Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Matthew Moneymaker,"I spoke with the father and later the witness herself. They are both credible. This is not a hoax report. It happened less than a week ago from the time of this posting.Before calling the father of the witness I had figured out the location and examined aerial photos of the surrounding landscape on Google Maps and Bing Maps. There are open fields nearby, and a large swamp 100 yards or so north of the patch of woods, but also some businesses nearby including a Motel 6. That made me somewhat doubtful at first, but this is the very edge of town, not in the middle.The relative lack of contiguous tree cover in the general area, compared to most sighting areas, also made me doubtful before I spoke with the witness and her father. I spoke with the father first. He is a pastor and high school teacher in Mansfield. He mentioned that there were lots of deer tracks in exposed patches of ground around that parcel of woods when he went to investigate the site the day after his daughter's sighting. Deer tracks are likely still visible around there. I spoke with the daughter later in the day today. She is very credible. She's a nursing student at the nearby University and works as a waitress in town. Nothing about her story seemed unusual except for the location. She was certain the gray furred sasquatch stood at least seven feet tall, possibly eight feet tall. Based on its height she was certain that it was not some other type of animal nor a person in a costume. They way it bolted off when it fled is what frightenned her most. It was very fast.As she walked out of the gym around midnight and turned to her right in the direction of her vehicle she was walking in the direction of the treeline. She heard the crack of a twig breaking and looked up in time to see the creature turning to run back into the woods about 30 yards away from her, illuminated by the lighting for the brand new parking lot. It ran back into the woods at an angle to the right and was quickly obscured from her view by the corner of the gym building. She only saw a side view of it as it ran off with large arms swinging. She said she most likely would not have noticed it at all but for the noise of the twig snapping, which she assumed was caused by the creature standing on wood debris.There were no other vehicles parked on that side of the buliding and no vehicles driving on the roads within view.Whichever way that deer would use to access that island of woods behind the Warehouse Gym is likely the same pathway the sasquatch would have used. If deer or a sasquatch came to those woods from the north then there is only 100 yards or so of exposed field to cross (in the dark) before reaching a large swampy area connected to the Jerome Fork of the Mohican River. So the location is more plausible for a sasquatch than it appears at first in aerial photos. The key element is the presence of deer. That shows that there is both a pathway and a reason for a sasquatch to approach the edge of development late at night.The swampy zone directly to the north is a good area to look around right now. A specific place to look around for tracks would be where the swampy zone and Jerome Fork passes underneath the 71 freeway. Follow the deer paths in the area.",24,,,,,,

Strange animal sounds occurred on Rosedale Rd,Cambridge,Putney ridge,"What myself and brother in law found was a structure built of mainly blackberry vines. We were scouting for deer on an abandoned farm in an area that had been stripped for coal 35yrs prior. Deer were plentiful, but not as much as present day. When came across it when we both were following a path that materialized and split in two directions around a spoil bank. My brother in law went one way I the other, both paths lead to the top of the spoil were we came on the structure. We were in total amazement noting it was kind of an igloo shape with an opening to enter. The briars where woven together to form the walls and the inside had been cleared like it had been mowed.","None that I recall, though I wish I knew what to look for at the time",Previously explained. Brother in law was a deputy sheriff at the time,No,Sunny beautiful fall evening,Old strip mine,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator James Thompson,"I talked to the witness at great length to get a full understanding of what it was he found that day back in 1979.The witness had recently been discharged from the military, his brother-in-law and him went out to check an area they planned on hunting. As they were following a path, it split and they each took a fork. The paths came back together near a strip pit wall. They both emerged from the briars into an open area only to find a structure that was 'made or woven' from the surrounding vegetation.The vines and vegetation were not leaning against each piece, but were woven into a domed structure with an opening. The witness got down on his hands and knees and looked inside. The inside of the structure had about 4 foot height at the center and his 6 foot frame could have easily stretched out inside with plenty of room left over on the bare floor of the structure.The purpose of the structure had baffled him and his brother-in-law for years. The witness had recently watched an old T.V. episode on the Ohio Grassman and saw a structure that reminded him of what he came across years ago. They were similar in shape and fabrication except the one they found that day was not as tall.The area that this was found in is very remote, a scraggly terrain of old strip mining land that is in the midst of what Don Keating called in the 1980s, the Saquatch Triangle.A month later, the brother-in-law was hunting about a mile from there and heard a sound that would keep him out of that area after dark to this day.",,,,,,,
Report,69304,Class B,2021-06-07,"Salt Fork boaters hear a loud, deep howl (""Ohio Howl"") from adjacent shore",2021/06/08,Spring,June,Ohio,Guernsey,Salt Fork State Park,Cambridge,Cadiz Rd/US22,"Earlier this evening (6-5-21) 4 of us were boating at Salt Fork in Ohio. I live less than 10 miles so Ive fished and boated out here for years. This evening (8pm, lake is very busy with several boats in ski zone), we decided to take a break from the ski zone and headed back into a cove for a few minutes. After going about half way back into the cove, we all heard an unusual sound come from our back left (heavily wooded area). It was loud enough to hear over the motor. I shut off the engine so we could figure out what it was. The only way I can describe the sound is like an old mechanical tornado/air raid siren starting to wind up. The sound had a very unusual pronounced low end frequency, or bassy in laymans terms. You could literally almost feel the sound. There are no sirens located out here. I have never heard a sound like that out here, or anywhere before. Weve all heard stories of Sasquatch being out here, but Im very skeptical of this stuff and joke about it usually on every outing. I thought it was unusual, but Bigfoot was definitely not my first answer as to what we heard. After we got back home and kids in bed I googled Bigfoot air raid siren and eventually came across an audio clip called the Ohio Howl from the BFRO website, and its very close to sounding like what we heard, except ours was closer to us.","Girlfriend said she heard knocking sounds, I do not remember hearing them.","3, my girlfriend, a coworker, and his wife","Weve heard many stories about supposedly being Bigfoots at the park, but Im skeptical and havent looked a whole lot into it",8:00pm about hour maybe before sunset,Heavily wooded area next to lake.,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator James Thompson,"I spoke with the witness on the phone and he identified the area they were at, where the sound came from and the details of the encounter.I also spoke with a local bigfoot group that regularly has members that spend weekend evenings doing hikes, camping and investigations in Salt Fork. They reported back to me that they did indeed have someone in the park that night, they were not doing vocals.I then spoke with park rangers to see if any of their watercraft enforcement craft were active in the area. They were not. DEERASSIC is located across St.Rt. 22 about a mile away and they were not having any activities that weekend.There is a road adjacent to the wooded area that the sound came from. It is used by night fishermen where the road meets the lake. That section of wooded area does not have any hiking trails and the under brush is very heavy this time of year.This area as well as other areas like it in Salt Fork has produced many reports from credible witnesses like this one.",5,,,,,,
Report,69490,Class B,2021-07-24,Missing chickens lead to discovery of large footprints by chicken coop near Bloomingdale,2021,Summer,July,Ohio,Jefferson,Right off of the Bloomingdale exit of Route 22,Bloomingdale,Route 22,"On July 9th at approximately 10:00 A.M. I noticed my five chickens were missing. The chicken coop was full of feathers but no bodies or blood. I did a perimeter check and came across an extremely large footprint. I went back to the house and brought down a tape measure to the footprint and measured it and took pictures with the tape measure beside it. The foot print measured Length: 18"" Width: 9""-10"".","There have been strange noises, growls, howls, etc. These noises have happened after the prints were found.",No other witnesses.,Years before there have been other incidents in the area.,The print was found at approximately 10:00 A.M. sunny daylight conditions.,Heavily wooded area with a small creek.,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator James Thompson,"I found out about the event through a mutual friend. Not knowing the witnesses address, I contacted his brother, who called him and gave me directions. I met the witness walking along the road. He had come out to meet me because his driveway and house is hard to find. He gave me a rundown of the events as we made our way back to his place.He had been sitting on his front porch the morning of the 9th of July drinking coffee. After getting his second cup he noticed his chickens were quiet that morning. He hadn't even heard the rooster crow. As he walked up to the coop he noticed that the ground inside the pen was covered with feathers. The gate was closed but not latched. Inside the coop also had feathers everywhere, but no chickens, no blood.Thinking a raccoon or coyote could have taken them, he started looking around his property for evidence of what direction they might have been taken. As he is checking the area below the coop, along side the creek in the mud he finds a very large print. Not thinking anyone would believe him, he takes pictures of it using a tape measure for scale. It is over 18 inches.I got there in the evening about an hour before dark. He first took me down to where he found the track. Eastern Ohio had been experiencing an extended period without any measurable rain. I was surprised to find the track still there in the dry creek. I stepped back to get an idea of of which way it had traveled. It seemed to be using the creek to move through the property. There was a bend in the creek and I could see where the grass was disturbed where the creature had stepped before it hit the muddy area.It was starting to get dark so we went up to the coop. The pen was between two out buildings. It had a solid wall back and the front was comprised of 6 ft. high fence and a narrow gate.By this time the feathers were all cleaned up, the dirt floor was hard with no impressions. Using a flash light I inspected the inside of the hutch. He had 4 chickens and a rooster that were missing. Looking around the hutch I noticed some long hairs on a screw that was just inside the door about 4 ft off the floor.With the daylight fading I decided to come back the next day to continue the investigation. I returned around noon the next day with fellow BFRO investigator Jason Kolvalski. After familiarizing Jason with the terrain we proceeded to the creek area where the track and trackline was discovered. We documented and took pictures of the footprint and took measurements of the trackline in the grass. The tracks were between 51 and 55 inches apart. I proceeded to cast the track in the dry mud while Jason scouted around the surrounding area for any other evidence of travel or prints.Not finding any other signs, we proceeded to the chicken pen while the cast dried. The witness had picked up all the feathers in preperations for getting some more chickens. The only access into the coop was through the gate. It was never latched, just pushed shut. There was chicken wire over the top to keep out hawks, but it had been separated at the seams. We looked, but found no evidence of hair, fur or feathers in the wire. Looking around inside the coop Jason pointed out some strands of hair that was on a wire basket hanging from the ceiling. Putting on latex gloves and using a sterilized pair of tweezers we placed the hair from the basket and the screw by the door into individual bags, 6 in total. No other signs or evidence was found in the coop area.Talking with the witness before leaving, we asked if ther was anything that they noticed prior to and after the chickens were taken. He stated that his daughter had visited the day before the incident and noticed and asked about a nasty smell in the air. He told her something was probably dead up in the woods and would check but he never found anything. He also stated that he has been hearing thumps and howling like sounds off to the south of his property.I returned a few days later and placed a long duration recording device on the property and will continue to monitor it. The witness also talked to his neighbor that lives on the top of the hill across from him. The neighbor has also lost some chickens and has heard strange sounds late at night to include heavy breathing. It has unsettled him to the point he once called his son to come over to check the area and now carries his shotgun with him when he is on the porch late at night. ",9th,,,,,,
Report,69469,Class B,2021-07-19,Couple returning home spots a bigfoot crossing their driveway outside Columbiana,2021,Summer,July,Ohio,Mahoning,[Investigator Note:,Columbiana,Rt 46,Through the years I have had several sightings and interactions with what appears to be a bigfoot and family. We own the better part of mystic woods in Columbiana OH. When the gas and oil companies started installing pipelines years back we started having encounters.,Moved unbelievably fast. And was very large!,Two,Have had several incidents over the years. First incident involved multiple witnesses.,Warm clear evening.,Front yard rural pond within 20 ft of overgrown brush.,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator James Thompson,"I contacted the witness the morning after the sighting and agreed to meet him there that afternoon. After arriving there I talked to the husband and wife about what they witnessed when they came home last night. After being briefed, the wife went inside their house and I had the husband take me through what he experienced.From where the creature crossed the driveway the husband thought it might have been picking up horse chestnuts, an acorn type nut, so we looked for signs around the trees. Not finding anything, we went back to where it crossed the drive way.As they were coming down the driveway, he was paying attention to the edge of the pond, only a couple feet to the left, when his wife, riding in the passenger seat cried out, ""What is that !!""  As he turned to look, it had aready crossed the driveway and was moving  through the yard towards the pond. He lost sight of it when it went into the tall grass and cattails. I had him place me where he was on the driveway and I had him stand where the creature was when he first saw it. Using my range finder I found the distance to be 16 yards. Not finding any sign in the mowed grass, we appoached the pond. I asked him if he or anyone else had come down to look in this area and he replied to me, no. Nobody had come back to the spot.Approaching the pond, I could see something quite large had gone through there. At first there's about 4ft high grass that goes in about 6ft before the cattails start. The cattails go another 10ft before there is open water in the small pond.There were definite impressions in the grass area, about eight of those other than the matted grass. I could make out what appeared to be finger tips or toe impressions, roughly the size of the thickness of a roll of half dollars, in the mud. After photographing them, I backed out to investigate the trail it made through the grass. Other than matted grass, I could not find any impressions in the ground. The rim around the pond has about 10ft of mowed grass before it reaches the woods. Going into the woods I found nothing out if the ordinary. Coming back to the house, the husband informed on numerous occasions he would see something looking in the windows. His daughter who was visiting at the time saw one watching her, it's face being just below the top of the window. I looked at the area around the windows. The owner had let the rose bushes grow unattended and they are quite thick in both window areas, but you could see where something had worn an area on the ground. The height from the ground to the soffit is 10ft. The top of window is 9ft.I went back to the pond to cast the most castable impression out of the ones there. It was a palm imprint. It appeared to be a left palm. The thumb seemed to be laying flat. The next two fingers were spread but were deep into the mud. The next two fingers were visible but not as pronounced as the others.After removing the cast, the husband called his wife out to look at it.This gave me the opportunity to question the wife on just what she saw. I had her place me on the driveway where she was in the car when she saw it cross. She stood where it crossed and I ranged her at 18 yards. I then had her take me through from where she first saw it untill it crossed the driveway into the yard. She started by the Horse Chestnut trees walking infront of them about 20ft to the driveway and across into the grass. I then had the husband go into the yard where he saw it and hold his arm out at the height it was. While he stood there, I had the wife come down and stand at where she thought the length of it from her husband would be.The measurement I took while they stood there was 5ft tall, 8ft wide. The husband said it was not flat on the ground. He could see it's limbs moving, kind of a jumping.When I was watching the wife earlier take me through it's path, her dog was following her. The dog paused right before the driveway sniffing the ground then moving away. When I looked at where it sniffed, there were indentations in the ground of similar size as by the pond. I was able to cast that impression as well.I spent about four hours at the site and found both the husband and wife very credible on what they saw just 23 hours prior.

Report,69006,Class A,2021-04-10,Hikers dusk sighting in Stinchcomb Wilfdlife Refuge (OKC),2019,Spring,April,Oklahoma,Oklahoma,"When I lived in NW Oklahoma City, I would frequently take evening walks at Stinchcomb Wildlife Refuge. The preserve is roughly 1000-acres located on the suburbs of Oklahoma City and Yukon adjacent to the Wiley Post Airport. Beginning from the parking lot at end of NW 50th street, the maintenance road will take you 2.5 miles upriver to the Kilpatrick bridge, where the N. Canadian river enters the reserve. However, the city only maintains the trail to the remote communication building, from there the trail becomes overgrown in the summers. The park is typically visited by local neighbors, bicyclists, horseback riders, and dog lovers.","Oklahoma City, OK",River Road (dirt hiking path),"This evening, I decided to venture pass the communication building as the foliage was still at ease. I continued another ½ mile up the path to where the powerlines cross the river, from here the river bank drops 15ft, giving a nice view of the river below. As I approached this area, my eyes were immediately caught by someone down below at the river edge. What I saw was an all-black figure down at the river edge about 250ft away. I thought it was strange because not many people hike off trail into the preserve during the summers nor late in the evening or even pass the communication building. As I watched this man down at the river bank, I started to notice settle detail like golden-red hair in the sunset. I also didnt notice any distinct clothing but hair alone. At this moment I remember being very confuse to what I was seeing. Whoever was down at the river, began to walk inland using its arms to move the reed bushes. That I saw its long hair dangling from its arm, shoulder to hand. Omg, its bigfoot I thought. I immediately began to reach for my phone without taking my eyes off the creature, that is when it noticed me. What terrified me the most was not able to make out any details in the face as we made eye contact. That is when I ran. I continued to ran until I met a couple with their dog back at the communication building. I will never forget the look of confusion on their faces when I came sprinting around the corner. I wanted to tell them about my experience but I continued to run as I thought they would not believe me. The following day I returned to look for footprints but was unable to venture into the overgrown foliage. The experience was not enough to scary me away completely, instead I was more cautious of the time of day and surroundings. I continued to exercise at Stinchcomb until I moved to AZ in July 2019.","The week prior I saw a homeless women making camp in the woods. Her hair was messy so I initially thought this was her at first. However, this was 1 mile downriver from where I saw the creature.",Myself.,I have been told by my coworker as he knows I frequently walk the trails. Also there is rumors of tree structures deep in the reserve. But these could have been built by teenagers who live in the nearby neighborhood. As I have seen many adolescents with their friends exploring the woods.,"Monday, April 15, 2019 at approximately 7:10pm is when I saw the creature. (I had just picked up my taxes before the office closed)",Wildlife refuge park located on the suburbs of Oklahoma City and Yukon.,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Matthew Moneymaker,"I spoke with the witness, Chase Collins, by phone. He now lives in Arizona and works as a night auditor at a local resort. He lived in Oklahoma City for a year or so and would walk along the same trail once or twice per week. He would never walk as far as he did on this occasion because beyond a certain point the road was not maintained and was very overgrown.As stated in his report he estimates his distance was 250 feet or so from the figure. He watched it for 10-15 seconds before reaching for his phone to take photos. The figure was already moving into thicker brush by the time he got his phone in position to take photos. He was very certain that it was covered with dark fur that had a reddish-brown tinge on the edges. The fur was hanging down from its arms as it was parting the reeds to move back into the woods away from the river bank.The location of the witness when he spotted the figure:35.5394882, -97.6781140The approximate location of the figure:35.5399187, -97.6790202The BFRO shot two episodes of Finding Bigfoot in Oklahoma. One segment of one episode was the investigation of a credible sighting by two kayakers within this same refuge. There were other second hand stories as well. This swampy refuge is crawling with wildlife. The only hunting allowed is for waterfowl, and only during that season. No camping allowed and theres only a few trails, and only on the perimeter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE (7/29/21)>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Hello BFRO,My name is Ryan White and Im writing you this email in response to a specific Bigfoot report on your website Report #69006 Hikers dusk sighting in Stinchcomb Wildlife Refuge. I recently became aware of this Bigfoot sighting report which, according to your records, occurred on Monday, April 15th, 2019. I read the report for the 1st time on July 28th, 2021.Im a part of a Bigfoot Group called the North Canadian River Project which is a group based out of the El Reno & the OKC area. We were planning to go kayaking on the North Canadian River on Saturday, April 13th, 2019 on a group investigation. Due to weather we made the decision to not go kayaking that day. A small group of us (3) to be exact (Ryan White, Evans Bailey, & Jody Blaylock), still wanted to investigate on this date despite the bad weather. Our backup plan was to meet at the parking area of the Stinchcomb Wildlife Refuge and hike trails and the perimeter road looking for signs of any Sasquatch type activity. Once again, our hike occurred 2 days before your Sighting Report on Monday, April 15th, 2019.You may be interested to know that we found a line of tracks which clearly showed right and left prints that were anywhere from a quarter of a mile to a half mile long.  The. Tracks were a consistent 10.5 inches. We documented our hike with some video footage of the trackway. The video footage can be found on a site called bitchute.com and Ill provide the exact link of the video at the end of this message. Points of interest in the video:(Trackway Segment 1) 9:37 - 15:03(Trackway Segment 2) 16:54 - 19:42(Measurement of Track) @ 19:00(Well House Reference) @ 17:47Your Eyewitness Report calls it a communication building.(Power line Cut Footage) @ 19:42Your Sighting Report happened very close to the Power Line Cut towards the North section of the park. Our trackway we found may or not be related to the creature seen in your sighting report. Our group was interested in getting your response to the tracks we discovered. Thank you for your time and reviewing our findings.

I was on a long downhill then a long uphill into a left hand turn. As I came over the hill, in the distance at the top of the next hill, something reddish brown crossed the road.

It was going from south to north across the highway. He was at a distance and could not estimate the height but was certain it was on two legs and moving quickly. There were no other vehicles on that portion of 144 at the time.He returned shortly after the incident to look for tracks but there is not enough bare soft ground on the shoulder of the highway to create any foot impressions.,30,,,,,,

Report,71700,Class A,2021-10-07,Trucker's daylight sighting of a Sasquatch in Francis Marion National Forest,2021,Spring,March,South Carolina,Berkeley,The route I took that time was through the back country due to google maps trying to give the most economical route. To the best of my memory it was near Hwy 41 and Steed Creek Road.,Huger,Hwy 41,I witnessed a 8-9 ft tall upright hominoid creature with black hair and brownish grey skin apparent on its face chest and abdomen. There was also noticeable scraggly matted hair hanging from its arms. It had wide bold shoulders and hair partly covering its forehead. The eyes were wide set and large.,,I was alone,I have seen other reports on the bfro site.,It was around 4pm on a semi cloudy day,It was a swampy flooded area. Recent rains brought the water level up to the edge of the road in many places.,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Matthew Moneymaker,"I spoke to the witness, Kris K., at length. He is a long haul trucker, originally from Michigan but now lives outside Toronto Canada. He has driven loads down to the Nucor plant a few times. On this occassion he had changed some preferences on his Google Maps app. This caused him to be re-routed to a more ""economical"" route once he was in the vicinity of Nucor. The route took him along roads that were nearly flooded from recent heavy rains. The flood water at the edge of the road on both sides made him too nervous to stop the truck after he spotted the sasquatch.He was driving southwest on Cainhoy Road. The sasquatch was on the right side of the road, roughly 60-90 feet into woods. It was early Spring so the leaves had not grown back on the trees. He got only a brief look at the sasquatch but it was long enough to notice the fur pattern and other elements. The fur was thinner on the chest and abdomen compared to the arms and legs. The hair was was not thick (or not present at all) on the face. He described the skin color as brown-ish gray. The hair on the arms was longer and possibly matted. One arm was outstretched onto the trunk of a broken tree. The most impressive and shocking element of its appearance was its size -- its height and broad shoulders and powerful build. The observation was too brief for Kris to recall whether the saquatch was actually standing in water or rather in a spot not covered by the flood water. ",,,,,,,
Report,69008,Class A,2021-04-11,Sighting by motorist in thick river bottom 75 miles northeast of Memphis,2021,Spring,March,Tennessee,Dyer,"[Investigator Note: The sasquatch was spotted less than 100 feet from a small river that serves as the boundary between Dyer County and Gibson County. It was on the Gibson County side of the boundary. The witness was driving along Hwy 104 coming from Trenton towards Dyersburg. He was passing through Macedonia Bottom. The sasquatch was on the driver's left side 30 yards back into the woods from the road, striding parallel to road, moving toward the river. The witness was roughly 50 yards before the river and county line.",Between Trenton Tennessee and Dyersburg Tennessee,Highway 104,"I was driving on Highway 104 between Trenton Tn and Dyersburg Tn .

He is a woodworker and fence builder. He lives in Tatumville, less than 5 miles from the location of the sighting. He is married and has four grown boys. His wife and one of his boy was with him in the vehicle when the sighting occured but they didn't see the figure. He only saw it for a few seconds as it took a few strides in the direction of the river.Although his observation was brief the witness was very certain about what he saw. He is confident that it was not a person. It was 30 yards from the edge of the road. It was tall and covered with dark fur. He had a side view of it and said it had noticeably long arms.He doubts that a person would be walkiing in that bottom so close to that creek because it is ""so full of snakes.""

I didn't want to submit it at first, but based on the number of sightings identified I am now forwarding on what I saw.","Only that I believe that the little sound devices on my car are what caused it to come out and cross the street.  I don't remember where I got them now, but I honestly believe that whatever sound came out of them while I was driving was what caused this creature to be so blatant about running across the road in front of us.  Otherwise, it could have easily stayed where it came from and I would have completely driven by it without even knowing that it was there.","Only my son, but he didn't see anything as he was young and based on his height while he was seated. It also happened very quickly.",The reason I submitted this was because you have a couple of other sightings reported in the same county in the same year and so I don't believe that I was just seeing things.,It was between 9 and 10 in the morning based on the function we were going to.  It was clear and calm and I could see perfectly well without any glare from the sun.,"236 has lots of trees and there is a stream that crosses under the road (if I remember correctly) just a short ways down from where we spotted this creature.  It isn't a main highway, but it is a pretty drive.",Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Gary Christensen,"I spoke with the witness by phone. His verbal report was consistent with his written report. During our conversation he recalled these additional details:The creature was standing on the left side of the road and ran on two legs across the road to his right. He estimates that it was 6 feet plus in height and was built very powerfully. It moved very quickly with a smooth gait. He did not recall any smell or facial features. The distance between it and his car was several car lengths, and he did not believe he was traveling very fast during the encounter. The weather was clear and calm and the time was around 8:30 am. He felt strongly that the deer whistles on his car alerted the creature and might have contributed to the aggression it showed when shaking the tree after crossing the road. He did clearly see the tree shake violently but did not actually see the creature do the shaking.I did a search of the area on Google Earth and found that the forest was much thicker in the direction that the creature ran. The North Fork of the San Gabriel River was less than 1/2 mile away.I found the witness to be very sincere and credible and believe he had an encounter with a bigfoot.",24,,,,,,

I'd have to say its 400 to 1000 ft from the powerlines leaving Gorst going towards Belfair on the left.,"Gorst, WA",Old Belfair Valley Rd,"I was driving to work this morning and came around a right hand corner and less than 100 ft in front of me was a large upright dark hairy object/animal/person in the roadway walking briskly from the left to the right. It was standing on two legs. I observed long arms swinging with the hands bent backwards like if you were swimming, as it walked quickly to the base of the bank next to the road. By the time I was parallel with where it crossed it was gone. It did not look at me.",,,,"5:26am, dark , when sun came up it was cloudy out.","The environment is maples and alders with grass and ferns on a bank leading up from the road, and a stand of larger trees up the bank from the roadway. The area in behind has been logged and replanted in the last 5 or so years. On the other side of the roadway it drops down to Gorst Creek.",Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Matthew Moneymaker,"I spoke with Jill Bangart. Great witness.  She is very credible and very certain about what she saw on Friday morning before dawn. The sasquatch was only ten feet from the car when it disappeared from view in the trees on the edge of the road. Right before that the sasquatch was fully in her headlights as it sauntered off the road as she drove by.It was very tall. She couldn't give a height estimate but says it was much taller than the average person, and very muscular. The fur was ""dark and smooth"". It was not running across the road but rather walking. She believes she surprised it has she came around the curve. Jill commutes this route every week day around 5:30am on her way to the Navy Ship Yard where she works as a restoration contractor. There's a long history of sightings in this general area. Her commute at this hour would give her much higher odds for having a road crossing sighting than most folks in the area. Typically there a no vehicles, or very few, along this road at this hour. Why would a sasquatch be lurking around these woods a few miles from population? Answer: There are many deer in this area. It is a true deer hazard zone for motorists. She sees groups of deer near this road at least twice per week on her way to work. Both her and her son have had collisions with deer. It is a common occurance in this area.",27,,,,,,
Report,70737,Class B,2021-09-30,Heavy thuds and distinct rock clacking north of Teanaway Butte (Wenatchee NF),2010,Fall,October,Washington,Kittitas,In the mountains west of Jungle creek trail.,"Cle elum, Teanaway wilderness area",Teanaway rd North fork,I was hiking about 2-3 mile from our camp in Wenatchee National Forest and was sitting on a bluff that give an excellent view of the surrounding ridges. After a while of sitting and seeing nothing I hear a series of heavy sounding thuds that sound like they were in the rhythm of a person walking. I had no idea what it was. I thought maybe it was a deer bouncing away buy it didn't quite sound right. The thuds were almost cartoonishly heavy and loud.,,I was the only witness,No,Evening about 4pm,I was on a rocky bluff in an opening surrounded by pine trees and brush,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Matthew Moneymaker,I spoke with the witness by phone. He seems very credible and did not know beforehand that heavy thud sounds are a commom element of bigfoot encounters. The thud sounds combined with the rock clacking make this incident very likely a bigfoot encounter.,,,,,,,

Our group was built of 4 persons staying the night in a free camping area. I do not remember the exact date only it was late August.","Now that I think of it, the bag of Charcoal briquets was the main target, and when we went and looked at it in the morning, some was gone and marks all over the bag.","My friends in the tents only heard the noises outside, the rustling and grunting that occurred while it was going through the bags.","This is a first for me. And like I like I said, I want to believe this was a black bear, or racoons. But the pieces are not adding up to that conclusion. It wasn't until I told this story to some friends who recommended I report it.",Night - 3:00 AM,Forested area near river.,Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Jeff Sidebottom,I spoke to the witness on the phone. He didn't really have any further detail to add other than what he had already put in the report. He did state that the way the creature was positioned over the table and able to reach across it confirms it was not a black bear. He said it was too large and a bear could not have got into that position. No tracks were found. The only thing that was really messed with was the charcoal which the creature seemed highly interested in. ,08/27/2021,,,,,,

We were driving south on Highway 231 and as we approached Sanctuary Way (47.9763678, -117.7323568) just off the highway in the ditch I noticed a very large black ""thing"" in the tall yellow, uncut grass.

By the time we drove to it, we were traveling about 35-40 MPH.",,4,I have heard of one instance in the vicinity occurring two months prior.

It had been raining most of the afternoon and evening.","Mix of Farmland, trees and small mountains",Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Matthew Moneymaker,"I spoke with witness Rudy Peone by phone. He is credible and available to speak with local journalists about this recent incident, 25 miles northwest of Spokane.The incident happened at night but there were multiple witnesses. The other witnesses were children who were facing each other and talking when the figure first came into the drivers view. They turned to look just as the vehicle was passing the figure. They didnt see the same amount of details as the driver but they did all see a big dark figure among the yellow grass, illuminated peripherally by the headlights. They also saw that the figure was no longer there when the driver eventually turned around and drove back for a second look.The driver, Rudy, said the figure was apparently sitting on the edge of the ditch roughly three feet from the edge of the road. It was facing north. Its back was facing south. The road runs diagonally SW to NE in that section, so the figure would have seen vehicles approaching from the north.Rudy said it stepped away from the ditch edge and into the ditch as it was still haunched over, as if it was trying to avoid the headlights. Then it turned to watch as the vehicle passed by.He is certain that it walked on two legs and has two arms and hands and a head more like a human than a bear or wolf.",22,,,,,,

The low water bridge had 6 culverts that were about 4 feet high. The witness was in his 50s at the time. The Bigfoot stood up when he got within 15 feet of it. It had a black face, no muzzle or pointed ears. It had a broad flat nose and no hair on face. He can see it as if it was yesterday, massive shoulders and 4 feet across. It seemed curious. Arms seems disproportionately long. It looked like a muscular, well defined athlete. Chest was about 2 feet thick. It was an amazing sight. He has seen nothing in nature that compares to it. He believes that it didnt hear him coming because of water noise and he was driving slow. Witness states he has been in the woods a lot and knows what he saw. He would swear in court. The witness has been in ministry for 50 years.      At this time there were a lot of coal mines in the area. Its close to many West Virginia reports and is just several miles from where the Finding Bigfoot team spent time. ",12,,,,,,
